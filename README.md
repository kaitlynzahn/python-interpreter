# Python Interpreter

## Project Explanation
*Principles of Programming Languages FS20 Final Project description here*

## Team Members
- Rebecca Parker
- Samantha Sample
- Kaitlyn Zahn

## Requirements
- if/else blocks
- Variable definitions
- while and for Loops
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, ^)
- Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, ^=, %=)
- Conditional statements (<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=)
- Comments (lines that start with a ‘#’)
- Support Output operation (print function).
- *BONUS*: Syntax error message (this is where we did the accept/reject string. If the given code aka. grammar is not a Python language, reject it. In other words, throw a syntax error message).

## How to Use/Run the Interpreter
- In command line, navigate to src/com/popl/python-interpreter and run "javac PythonInterpreter.java" and then navigate to src and run "java com/popl/python_interpreter/PythonInterpreter"
